# Number Plate Detector Model
<p>This set of Notebooks provides a complete set of code to be able to train and leverage your own custom object detection model using the Tensorflow Object Detection API. 
<p>I have leverage Python Tensorflow Object Detection to be able to detect license plates using Kaggle Data. Once those plates have been detected one will be then able to apply OCR to extract the text from each and every plate using PyTorch and EasyOCR. </p>
